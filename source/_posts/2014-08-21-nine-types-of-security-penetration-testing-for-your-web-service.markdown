Nine types of security scanning:

 1. Boundary Check
 2. Cross site scripting
 
    xsser
 
 3. Fuzzing scan
 
    The term "Fuzzing" has a broad meaning in the security-testing domain, but most commonly it is used to describe the practice of generating random input for a target system, for example by trigger random mouse and keyboard clicks for user interface or by creating totally random input data to some kind of system. By doing this repeatedly over a prolonged period of time, the fuzzing "attack" strives to uncover instabilities in the target system which are not uncovered by a more structured testing process.
