<p>======Synchronize time with external NTP server on Windows Server 2008======</p>

<p>Time synchronization is an important aspect for all computers on the network. By default, the clients computers get their time from a Domain Controller and the Domain Controller gets his time from the domain’s PDC Operation Master. Therefore the PDC must synchronize his time from an external source. I usually use the servers listed at the NTP Pool Project website. Before you begin, don’t forget to open the default UDP 123 port (in- and outbound) on your (corporate) firewall.</p>

<p>First, locate your PDC Server. Open the command prompt and type:
  C:>netdom /query fsmo
Log in to your PDC Server and open the command prompt.
Stop the W32Time service:
  C:>net stop w32time
Configure the external time sources, type:
  C:> w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist:”0.pool.ntp.org, 1.pool.ntp.org, 2.pool.ntp.org”
Make your PDC a reliable time source for the clients. Type:
  C:>w32tm /config /reliable:yes
Start the w32time service:
  C:>net start w32time
The windows time service should begin synchronizing the time. You can check the external NTP servers in the time configuration by typing:
  C:>w32tm /query /configuration
You can also check the status:
  C:\Users\tmullaly>w32tm /query /status
