<p>The definition of &ldquo;a technology&rdquo;, excerpted from WINSTON &ldquo;Children of Invention Revisited&rdquo;, p. 3: &ldquo;Instead, we will think of technologies as consisting of several distinguishable but interacting aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li>skill, techniques, human activity-forms, or sociotechnical practices;</li>
<li>resources, tools, and materials;</li>
<li>technological products, or artifacts;</li>
<li>ends, intentions or functions;</li>
<li>background knowledge; and</li>
<li>the social contexts in which the technology is designed, developed, used and disposed of.</li>
</ul>


<p>These six aspects are present in every technology.&#8221;</p>

<p>Be able use these six (6) aspects to define the technology of a) your cell phone (&ldquo;cell phone technology&rdquo;) and either b) a pair of eyeglasses (invented in Pisa, Italy at the end of the thirteenth century) (WINSTON, Landes article, p 29-30) or c) a central power plant (the first one for electricity started up in 1881)(Wikipedia: [[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation|Electricity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation|Electricity</a> generation]], &ldquo;History&rdquo;)</p>
