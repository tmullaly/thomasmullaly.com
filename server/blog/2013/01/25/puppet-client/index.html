<p>====== Install puppet agent ======
  apt-get install puppet
====== Edit /etc/default/puppet ======
<code></p>

<h1>Defaults for puppet &ndash; sourced by /etc/init.d/puppet</h1>

<h1>Start puppet in boot?</h1>

<p>START=yes</p>

<h1>Startup options</h1>

<p>DAEMON_OPTS=&ldquo;&mdash;report&rdquo;
</code>
====== Add the puppet master host to DNS ======
In my case I&rsquo;m adding to the local hosts file because I don&rsquo;t have access to DNS:
  23.22.145.26    puppet</p>

<p>====== Check for connectivity to the puppet master======
  ping puppet</p>

<p>====== Agent Setup ======
  puppet agent &mdash;test</p>

<p>you should get this:
<code>
root@red:~# puppet agent &mdash;test
warning: peer certificate won&rsquo;t be verified in this SSL session
warning: peer certificate won&rsquo;t be verified in this SSL session
info: Creating a new SSL certificate request for red.cs.umb.edu

warning: peer certificate won&rsquo;t be verified in this SSL session
warning: peer certificate won&rsquo;t be verified in this SSL session
Exiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled
</code>
I got this because I reinstall the host and didn&rsquo;t backup the certs.

err: Could not request certificate: The certificate retrieved from the master does not match the agent&rsquo;s private key.
Certificate fingerprint: 4F:6B:D2:D7:A9:A4:DE:D6:59:AA:94:C8:59:26:3F:F5
To fix this, remove the certificate from both the master and the agent and then start a puppet run, which will automatically regenerate a certficate.
On the master:
  puppet cert clean red.cs.umb.edu
On the agent:
  rm -f /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/red.cs.umb.edu.pem
  puppet agent -t</p>

<p>Exiting; failed to retrieve certificate and waitforcert is disabled
</code></p>

<p>The Puppet agent found the puppet master, but it got stopped at the certificate roadblock. It isnâ€™t authorized to fetch configurations, so the master is turning it away.</p>

<p>====== Sign the cert on the puppet master======
=====List the certs waiting to be signed=====
  puppet cert list</p>

<p><code>
root@puppet:~# puppet cert list

=====Sign the cert=====
  puppet cert sign red.cs.umb.edu
